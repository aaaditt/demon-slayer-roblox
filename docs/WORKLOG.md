# Work log

## 2026-09-15 — Project initialization

- Inspected the empty workspace and empty remote; confirmed GitHub authentication and Roblox Studio installation.
- Cloned the repository. Initial sandbox attempt failed writing `.git/config`; an escalated retry succeeded.
- Confirmed Infinity Castle (2025) as the requested film baseline.
- Started source research with the official anime character pages, official episode pages, community technique references, and Roblox security documentation.
- Added the delivery plan, continuation rules, status, README, and ignore rules.
- Result: versionable project foundation; no playable game or completed runtime validation yet.

## 2026-09-15 — Research catalog and combat rules

- Resumed after the owner enabled unrestricted workspace access; reread all continuation documents.
- Installed local pinned Rojo 7.7.0 and Luau 0.738 binaries, plus the optional run-in-roblox runner. Tool binaries remain ignored.
- Researched official cast/story pages and community technique sections. Direct Fandom access failed; indexed search excerpts supplied secondary references. Recorded this limitation and the pending primary-scene audit.
- Added 81 cast records (44 selectable), 210 move entries, 19 location concepts, and 22 chronological encounter chapters. Added source, adaptation, spoiler, animation-production, and unrevealed-form metadata.
- Added generated Luau content and Markdown inventory, Rojo project mapping, pinned bootstrap, content validation, and pure combat/profile/lease rules.
- Initial rules test caught a Lua `and/or` nil-expression bug that retained a released lease; replaced it with an explicit conditional. The regression test remains.
- Result: data/rules foundation; server/client/world implementation is next. No Studio playtest claimed.
- Validation passed: catalog integrity, 4 Luau files compiled, all 8 core tests, and Rojo place build. The structural place has no gameplay bootstrap yet.
