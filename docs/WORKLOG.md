# Work log

## 2026-09-15 — Project initialization

- Inspected the empty workspace and empty remote; confirmed GitHub authentication and Roblox Studio installation.
- Cloned the repository. Initial sandbox attempt failed writing `.git/config`; an escalated retry succeeded.
- Confirmed Infinity Castle (2025) as the requested film baseline.
- Started source research with the official anime character pages, official episode pages, community technique references, and Roblox security documentation.
- Added the delivery plan, continuation rules, status, README, and ignore rules.
- Result: versionable project foundation; no playable game or completed runtime validation yet.

## 2026-09-15 — Research catalog and combat rules

- Resumed after the owner enabled unrestricted workspace access; reread all continuation documents.
- Installed local pinned Rojo 7.7.0 and Luau 0.738 binaries, plus the optional run-in-roblox runner. Tool binaries remain ignored.
- Researched official cast/story pages and community technique sections. Direct Fandom access failed; indexed search excerpts supplied secondary references. Recorded this limitation and the pending primary-scene audit.
- Added 81 cast records (44 selectable), 210 move entries, 19 location concepts, and 22 chronological encounter chapters. Added source, adaptation, spoiler, animation-production, and unrevealed-form metadata.
- Added generated Luau content and Markdown inventory, Rojo project mapping, pinned bootstrap, content validation, and pure combat/profile/lease rules.
- Initial rules test caught a Lua `and/or` nil-expression bug that retained a released lease; replaced it with an explicit conditional. The regression test remains.
- Result: data/rules foundation; server/client/world implementation is next. No Studio playtest claimed.
- Validation passed: catalog integrity, 4 Luau files compiled, all 8 core tests, and Rojo place build. The structural place has no gameplay bootstrap yet.

## 2026-09-15 — Playable game systems and Studio integration

- Implemented original R6 character/weapon geometry, nighttime wisteria hub, duel arena, and private themed rooms for the location catalog.
- Implemented server cast admission, cooldowns, energy, basic combo, line-of-sight hit geometry, wall-aware dashes, guard/parry, status handling, cancellation, NPC pursuit/technique selection, and movement anomaly checks.
- Implemented character/loadout selection, chronological mission waves/rewards/unlocks, respawns, arena rounds/scoring, save leases, and 5 Hz player snapshots.
- Built Journey, Characters, Techniques, Codex, Settings, HUD/cooldown UI, bounded local VFX, procedural joint poses, camera setup and keyboard/controller/touch bindings.
- Added engine and two-client Studio integration tests. Engine smoke passed 7/7.
- First multiplayer run failed because the legacy runner re-executed its plugin inside child test DataModels. Fixed the isolated test wrapper and closed only the orphan processes belonging to that test; the user's other open Studio project was preserved.
- Corrected multiplayer suite passed 8/8 with real clients, including camera, movement, remote admission, progression, PvP damage/scoring and respawn checks. Runtime test code is injected only into the temporary test copy.
- Corrected world signs/window orientation and prevented mouse clicks on UI buttons from also triggering basic attacks.
- Added checksum-pinned cross-platform tool bootstrap, CI validation/artifact workflow, setup instructions, architecture map, and QA evidence with explicit limits.
- Result: a locally playable development game. Authored art/choreography, full canonical environments/story/boss mechanics, live persistence QA, device polish and Roblox publishing are not complete.
